Methods for hospital stay and in hospital mortality, https://osf.io/5vjgn/

// all data used are from NICE, obtained through github repos van Zelst https://github.com/mzelst.
// we combine data from ICU and non ICU, we provide casemic information to keep this part of the interpretation. 
// we show new beds, which means new ward and ICU, even though ICU come from wards.
// we show total beds occupied are the beds of IC and non IC.
// we calcuate the average hospital stay for those who were dicharged or deceased that day.
// we plot these data not for the first couple of days of the pandemic for graphic reasons.
// we calculate the mortality as a percetnage by taking those who decesed as a percentage of the total number of beds the day before.
// we smooth all lines by making a running average with a 7 day window.
// we do not perform statisical inferences for simplicity sake.
